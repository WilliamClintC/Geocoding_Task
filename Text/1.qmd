# Current State {#sec-intro}

-   We are close to finishing there is a maximum of 52 places unmatched.

-   The 52 places can be sub categorized based on severity of the mismatch.

    Match

    :   -   [State/ZIP-Level -\> City/Exit-Level](#sec-place-name-level-mismatch) **-\> Road Level -\> [Place Name Level](#sec-place-name-level-mismatch)**

## **Place Name Level Mismatch (36 places)** {#sec-place-name-level-mismatch}

-   For example, “Three sisters truck stop at I-10 Exit 61, AZ, 12345, San Luis”.

    -   Match found for "I-10", "Exit 61", "AZ","12345", "San Luis".

    -   No match for “three sisters”

-   Previous discussions mention this can be defined as a match since it matches down to the "road level"

    -   William raises concerns because of inconsistency of address matching.
        Inconsistencies can be categorized into 2 categories.

        1.  Unexplained inconsistencies

            -   Minor (@sec-minor-mismatch) – 0.1 mile discrepancy

            -   Major (@sec-major-mismatch and @sec-major-mismatch-details ) – 6.2 mile discrepancy

        2.  Direction of exits (@sec-direction-mismatch)

            -   The current approach does not take exit direction into account

            -   3 mile discrepancy shown in example

## **Higher Level Mismatch (16 places)** {#sec-higher-level-mismatch}

-   There's only a match for city/exit/state/zipcode level (no place name match)

    -   There were at least 2 places I could not find manually

## Solutions Discussed

1.  Use Google address vs Truckers friend address to verify

2.  [Yellow Pages website](https://www.yellowpages.ca/) – phone number search

# Next Steps

1.  Yellow Pages scraping

2.  Write Data Appendix with clean code

3.  next meeting wed.
    11AM PST

## Maybe of Interest

-   [Iexit website](https://www.iexitapp.com/California/I-80/Exit%2089/40150) – has the ability to observe exit locations, direction and associated trucks stops.

    -   unlikely to be scrapable

    -   potential use –Use interstate exit latitude/longitude coordinates to identify nearby truck stops.

### Major Mismatch Details {#sec-major-mismatch-details}

1.  Truckers friend gives us the following address: "Circle K, 23260 Hwy 95, San Luis, **85349**"

2.  If we query this in Google Maps we may be led to an address: ["23260 US-95, Somerton, AZ **85350**, USA"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hzdLyktmMAriakVz5)

3.  Note: $85349 \neq 85350$

4.  The likely correct address is ["766 Main St, San Luis, AZ 85349, United States"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27KDFS7UUrqY51D6A)

5.  The difference is 6 miles south.
