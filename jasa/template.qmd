# Current State {#sec-intro}

-   We are close to finishing there is a maximum of 52 places unmatched.

-   The 52 places can be sub categorized based on severity of the mismatch.

    Match

    :   -   **State/ZIP level-\>City/Exit level -\> Road Level -\> [Place Name Level](#sec-place-name-level-mismatch)** (@sec-place-name-level-mismatch)

## **Place Name Level Mismatch (36 places)** {#sec-place-name-level-mismatch}

-   For example, “Three sisters truck stop at I-10 Exit 61, AZ, 12345, San Luis”.

    -   Match found for "I-10", "Exit 61", "AZ","12345", "San Luis".

    -   No match for “three sisters”

-   Previous discussions mention this can be defined as a match since it matches down to the "road level"

    -   William raises concerns because of Inconsistency of address matching.
        Inconsistencies can be categorized into 2 categories.

        -   Unexplained inconsistencies

            -   [Minor](#fig-Minor-mismatch) (@fig-Minor-mismatch) – 0.1 mile discrepancy

            -   [Major](#fig-Major-mismatch)(@fig-Major-mismatch and @sec-major-mismatch-details) – 6.2 mile discrepancy

        -   Direction of exits matter.
            The current approach does not take this into account.

    -   Solution discussed is to use Google address vs Truckers friend address to verify

-   **Tight Definition of Matching:theres only a match for city/exit/ state. Zipcode level\
    \
    **

    -   16 places are unmatched using stricter criteria.

    -   Theres at least 3 that arent findable

### Major Mismatch Details {#sec-major-mismatch-details}

Truckers friend gives us the following address *"Circle K,23260 Hwy 95, San Luis, **85349**"*

if we query this in Google map we are lead to an address *"23260 US-95, Somerton, AZ **85350**, USA"*

Note $85349 \neq 85350$
