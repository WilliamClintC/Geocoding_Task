# Sound Notification Fix

## Problem
The batch processor was throwing an error: `playNotificationSound is not defined`

## Root Cause
The `playNotificationSound` function was only defined in `3_coordinate_scraper.js` but was being called from the `batch_processor.js` file without being properly imported or defined.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added playNotificationSound function to batch_processor.js
```javascript
function playNotificationSound() {
    try {
        // System bell character - works on most systems
        process.stdout.write('\x07');
        
        // For Windows, play system sound
        if (process.platform === 'win32') {
            const { exec } = require('child_process');
            exec('powershell -c "[console]::beep(800,300)"', (error) => {
                if (error) {
                    console.log('ðŸ”” Bell notification sent (PowerShell beep failed)');
                } else {
                    console.log('ðŸ”” Sound notification played');
                }
            });
        } else {
            console.log('ðŸ”” Bell notification sent');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('ðŸ”” Notification attempted');
    }
}
```

### 2. Fixed incorrect function calls
Changed `this.playNotificationSound()` to `playNotificationSound()` in:
- Session expiration detection
- Session refresh request

### 3. Added function to 1_iexit_scraper.js
Ensured the function is available in the main scraper as well.

## Sound Notification Features

### When sounds are played:
- âœ… Session expiration detected
- âœ… New cURL command needed
- âœ… Verification page encountered

### Sound types:
- ðŸ”” System bell character (\x07) - works on all systems
- ðŸ”” Windows PowerShell beep (800Hz for 300ms) - Windows only
- ðŸ”” Fallback console message if sound fails

## Result
The batch processor will now:
1. âœ… Play sound notifications when session expires
2. âœ… Continue processing without crashing
3. âœ… Alert user audibly when cURL input is needed
4. âœ… Work on both Windows and other operating systems

## Testing
The fix has been applied to all files and should resolve the `playNotificationSound is not defined` error during batch processing.
