# iExit Scraper Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Direction Switching Issue
**Problem**: When clicking the "Switch Direction" button, ads would popup and stop the program.

**Solution**: Modified the `clickDirectionSwitchButton()` method in `3_coordinate_scraper.js` to:
- Close the current browser completely before switching directions
- Reopen a fresh browser instance
- Navigate directly to the opposite direction URL
- This prevents ads from interfering with the scraping process

**Files Modified**:
- `3_coordinate_scraper.js` - Updated `clickDirectionSwitchButton()` method

### 2. Added Session Expiration Detection
**Problem**: The scraper would continue running even when the session expired, showing verification pages like "Verifying you are human. This may take a few seconds."

**Solution**: Added comprehensive session expiration detection that:
- Checks for specific HTML elements (`.main-content`, `#bkObw1`, `.lds-ring`)
- Detects verification text patterns like "Verifying you are human", "checking your browser", etc.
- Immediately prompts for a new cURL command when session expires
- Automatically refreshes the browser with new authentication

**New Functions Added**:
- `checkSessionExpiration()` - Detects session expiration indicators
- `requestNewCurlCommand()` - Prompts user for fresh cURL command
- `checkAndHandleSessionExpiration()` - Handles the refresh process

**Files Modified**:
- `1_iexit_scraper.js` - Added session detection to main scraper
- `3_coordinate_scraper.js` - Added session detection to coordinate scraper
- `batch_processor.js` - Enhanced session checking in batch processor

### 3. Updated Output Directory
**Problem**: Files were scattered across different directories.

**Solution**: Consolidated all output files to save in:
```
C:\Users\clint\Desktop\Geocoding_Task\Iexit_scraper\scrape_for_interstate\batch_output\
```

**Files Modified**:
- `1_iexit_scraper.js` - Updated output directory paths
- `3_coordinate_scraper.js` - Updated CONFIG.OUTPUT_DIR
- `batch_config.js` - Already configured for batch_output directory

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
**Improvements**:
- Better detection of Cloudflare challenges
- Automatic session refresh on expiration
- Graceful browser restart for direction switching
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## How to Use the Improved Scraper

### For Regular Scraping
1. Run the scraper normally
2. If you see "Session expired detected!" message, provide a fresh cURL command
3. The scraper will automatically continue with the new session

### For Direction Switching
1. The scraper will now automatically close and reopen the browser when switching directions
2. No manual intervention needed for ads
3. Files will be saved to the `batch_output` directory

### Session Expiration Indicators
The scraper now detects these session expiration signals:
- "Verifying you are human"
- "checking your browser" 
- "verification is taking longer than expected"
- "needs to review the security of your connection"
- "enable javascript and cookies to continue"
- HTML elements: `.main-content`, `#bkObw1`, `.lds-ring`

### Getting a Fresh cURL Command
When prompted for a new cURL command:
1. Open your browser and go to https://www.iexitapp.com
2. Navigate to any exit page
3. Open Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to the Network tab
5. Refresh the page
6. Right-click on the main request → Copy → Copy as cURL
7. Paste the command when prompted

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Reliability**: No more ad interruptions during direction switching
2. **Continuity**: Automatic session refresh prevents long-running scrapes from failing
3. **Organization**: All output files in one dedicated directory
4. **Transparency**: Clear logging of session status and refresh actions
5. **User Experience**: Automated handling of common issues with clear prompts when needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test session expiration detection by waiting for a session to expire
2. Test direction switching on highways with both directions available
3. Verify all output files are saved to the `batch_output` directory
4. Test the batch processor with the new session handling
